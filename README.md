## How Java string is saved in binary?
As we know computers can understand only the binary language 0&1s. We humans use different language(English, Spanish etc) to communicate each other. In Java, String is basic entity to take human texts. Lets see how the java string is stored into computers.
Java String is nothing but the sequence of characters. String uses UTF-16(Unicode) encoding which is standard these days. UTF-16 is a character encoding that uses one or two 16-bit units (code units) to represent each code point.  (16 bits) can encode characters from U+0000 to U+FFFF directly (these are known as the Basic Multilingual Plane or BMP characters). beyond this range (U+010000 to U+10FFFF, which are known as Supplementary Characters) are encoded in UTF-16 using two code units, called a surrogate pair.

```
        String strA = "A";
        char[] chrArr = strA.toCharArray();
        char chrA = chrArr[0];  // 'A' stored using UTF-16 encoding in a char
        System.out.println("The character is: " + chrA); // A
        System.out.println("Unicode code point: " + (int) chrA); // decimal value 65
        System.out.println("Ascii encoding point: " + (int) chrA); // unicode is backward compatible to ascii so same decimal value 65
        System.out.println("Hex text value: " + Integer.toHexString(chrA)); // U+0041, which is hexadecimal for 65 without any leading zeros or the "U+"
        System.out.println("Binary representation: " + Integer.toBinaryString(chrA));// binary representation
        System.out.println("Hex to decimal value:" +  Integer.parseInt(Integer.toHexString(chrA), 16));
        System.out.println("Binary to decimal:" +Integer.parseInt(Integer.toBinaryString(chrA), 2));
```

Note that Unicode is backward compatible to ASCII which lacks wide characters(eg: other language characters). String is converted to character and then encoded to UTF16/Ascii representation and finally to binary. It is difficult to represent the decimal(base10) to binary(base2). So Hexadecimal(base 16) is used to represent the unicode/ascii decimal value. Hexa values - 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F, then 01,02... 09,0A,0B,0C,0D,0E,0F Easy to convert binary to hexa and vice versa.


## String concepts?
# Definition
public final class String ---> Immutable.  marked as final so value cannot be changed. if we try to modify, it creates a new object only.
    implements java.io.Serializable, ---->  convert object to streams to transfer to nw/db etc.
     Comparable<String>,  ---> implement compareTo method for comparsion
     CharSequence, ---> implements char related methods charat, etc.

# Creation/ Srting Pool concept
```
// Using literals
        String str1 = "main"; // saves in string pool
//Using new operator
        String str2 = new String("main"); // creates as new object.
        // it is also same as above. object created with chars
        char[] str3arr = {'m','a','i','n'};
        String str3 = new String(str3arr);
        System.out.println("literal == new object: " + (str1 == str2)); // false. str1 in string pool str2 in heap memory
        String str4 = str2.intern(); // Make string obj value available in string pool
        System.out.println("after intern: " + (str1 == str4)); // true
```
Output:
```
literal == new object: false
after intern: true
```
Using literal, string is created in string pool. if same value is created again, only variable is created and pointed to the same pool value.
new operator only creates in the heal memory. To make it available in the pool, intern() is called.

# char array
For interview programs, many times string is split into arrays and solve the problems.
```
        String str1 = "main";
        // to int stream
        str1.chars().forEach(System.out::println);
        str1.codePoints().forEach(System.out::println);
        // if characters were differnt language then chars() wont understand. eg
        String str6 = "Hello ðŸ‘‹";
        str6.codePoints().forEach(System.out::println); // it prints correctly the unknown characters
        // to array
        char[] chars= str.toCharArray();
        for (char a : chars) {
            System.out.println((int)a);
        }
```
